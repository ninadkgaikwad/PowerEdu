        We introduce \packageName{}, a beginner-friendly, open-source Power Systems package in the Julia programming 
        language for enabling a broad yet quick overview of essential programming aspects 
        required for analyses in multiple domains of Power Systems to budding power system 
        engineers. This package covers Power Flow using Dense and Sparse Data Structures, 
        Continuation Power Flow, State Estimation, Optimal Power Flow, Small-Signal Stability
        and Transient Stability Analysis. The package is scalable and user interactions with its
        component modules are highly customizable. In this paper, the main modules as part of the 
        package have been described, including any special data structure implementations required for
        the same, and the available scope of customizing algorithms as per the user's needs.
